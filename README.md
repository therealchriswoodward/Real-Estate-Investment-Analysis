# Real Estate Investment Analysis
Analyzing a real estate investment and measuring the asset's contribution to the imaginary investor's portfolio

***

# Project

In this project I have an imaginary investor wanting me to analyze a real estate asset he is seeking to purchase. I use arbitrary data for the sake of this project.

# Features

* **_Financial Analysis_**: Analyzed financial projections for the real estate asset.
* **_Monte Carlo Simulation_**: Built a simulator for simulating uncertain market conditions over any set period of time for any number of simulations.
  - **_Simulated Market Downturns_**: There is a 10% chance for a market crash or some other negative market event at any time during the simulation.
* **_Portfolio Analysis_**: Converted asset's financials to period over period returns for hypothetical portfolio analysis.
* **_Visualizations_**: Advanced visualizations to show in more detail the outcome of the monte carlo simulation.
* **_Scalability_**: This analysis can be performed for an asset of any price, with any expenses, with any number of units, and any income projections.
